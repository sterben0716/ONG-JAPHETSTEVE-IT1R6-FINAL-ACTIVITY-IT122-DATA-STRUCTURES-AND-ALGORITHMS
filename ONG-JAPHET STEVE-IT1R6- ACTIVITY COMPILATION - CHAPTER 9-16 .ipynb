      "Ans: When you initialize the Deck object, the two for loops of _init_ create Card objects representing all the cards in a 52-card deck and add them to the card list. The first loop goes from 2 to 15 because the first value of a card is 2 and the last value of a card is 14 (the ace). Each time around the inner loop, a new card is created using the integer from the outer loop as the value (i.e. 14 for an ace) and the integer from the inner loop as the suit. This process creates 52 cards – one card for each combination of suit and value. After the method creates the cards, the shuffle method of the shuffle module randomly rearranges the items in the card list; imitating the shuffle of a deck of cards.

In this case, our event is the set E={2,4,6}. If the result of our random experiment belongs to the set E, we say that the event E has occurred. Thus an event is a collection of possible outcomes. In other words, an event is a subset of the sample space to which we assign a probability. Although we have not yet discussed how to find the probability of an event, you might be able to guess that the probability of {2,4,6} is 50 percent which is the same as 12 in the probability theory convention.

The first loop goes from 2 to 15 because the first value of a card is 2 and the last value of a card is 14 (the ace). Each time around the inner loop, a new card is created using the integer from the outer loop as the value (i.e. 14 for an ace) and the integer from the inner loop as the suit. This process creates 52 cards – one card for each combination of suit and value. After the method creates the cards, the shuffle method of the shuffle module randomly rearranges the items in the card list; imitating the shuffle of a deck of cards. Our deck has another method called rm_card which removes and returns a card from the card list, or returns None if it is empty.')\n",

Our goal is to assign probability to certain events. For example, suppose that we would like to know the probability that the outcome of rolling a fair die is an even number. In this case, our event is the set E={2,4,6}. If the result of our random experiment belongs to the set E, we say that the event E has occurred. Thus an event is a collection of possible outcomes. In other words, an event is a subset of the sample space to which we assign a probability. Although we have not yet discussed how to find the probability of an event, you might be able to guess that the probability of {2,4,6} is 50 percent which is the same as 12 in the probability theory convention. Outcome: A result of a random experiment. Sample Space: The set of all possible outcomes. Event: A subset of the sample space.')\n",
